# Sandman Auto-Generated API with SQLite

This project demonstrates the use of **Sandman2** to auto-generate a RESTful API based on an SQLite database.

## Tool Used

- **Sandman2**: A Python-based tool that automatically generates a RESTful API from an existing database.

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create an SQLite Database

1. Used SQLite to create a database file called `my_database.db`.
2. Created a sample table named `products` with the following structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       price REAL
   );
   ```
3. Added sample data to the `products` table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO products (name, description, price) VALUES
   ('Product1', 'Description for Product1', 19.99),
   ('Product2', 'Description for Product2', 29.99),
   ('Product3', 'Description for Product3', 39.99);
   ```

### Step 2: Install Sandman2

Installed Sandman2 using the following command:
```bash
pip install sandman2
```

### Step 3: Run Sandman2 with SQLite Database

To generate the API, we ran Sandman2 with the SQLite database as follows:

```bash
sandman2ctl sqlite:///path/to/my_database.db
```

This command automatically generated an API with endpoints for the `products` table, allowing us to interact with the data.

### Step 4: Testing the API

After starting Sandman2, the API was accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here are some of the available endpoints:

- **GET /products**: Retrieves all products.
- **GET /products/{id}**: Retrieves a specific product by ID.
- **POST /products**: Adds a new product.
- **PUT /products/{id}**: Updates an existing product by ID.
- **DELETE /products/{id}**: Deletes a product by ID.

You can test these endpoints using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or your web browser.

## Screenshots

A PDF file with screenshots of the setup and API interaction process is included in the repository:

- [Screenshots PDF](screenshots.pdf)

The screenshots demonstrate the following steps:
1. Creating the SQLite database.
2. Running Sandman2 to auto-generate the API.
3. Testing the API endpoints.

## Repository Structure

- `my_database.db`: The SQLite database file.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.
- `screenshots.pdf`: PDF file with screenshots documenting the process.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch`

If you encounter an error when pushing to GitHub, set the upstream branch by using:
```bash
git push --set-upstream https://github.com/yourusername/Sandman_AutoGenerated_API.git master
```
